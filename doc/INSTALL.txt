The current version is very different from the old version but the logic inside is still the same.
I call this version 0.1, it will have new features:
	PXE Booting
	Code address space and Data address space is seperated
	Unified Memory and Module manager (the System module)
	Threading
	Ethernet Driver (for RTL8139, still working)
	
Install guide:
	Get a TFTP and DHCP boot server (Tftpd32 is recommend)
	Compile all the source file in source directory by FASM
	Copy all binary to TFTP server root directory, config DHCP boot server to boot "Loader3.bin"
Note: My program is developed and tested on real machine, not virtual machine. In order to
boot this program, the virtual machine must support PXE booting.	
	
Booting process:
	Loader3.bin is loaded by PXE Boot ROM
	Loader will download the other modules
	Switch to Protected Mode
	Init System module, create Memory table and Module table
	Init Interrupt module
	Init Thread module
	
Module initialization process has some little different from the old version, but in essential,
it still same. See note.txt for more detail.
