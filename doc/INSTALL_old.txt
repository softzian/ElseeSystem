Install guide (outdated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools:
	- FASM (http://flatassembler.net/)
	- Bochs (http://bochs.sourceforge.net/)
	- A DOS floppy disk image
	- A virtual floppy program (I use VFD: http://vfd.sourceforge.net/)
	- A Hex editor
	
1. Compile all the source with FASM.
2. Use Bochs to create a 20 MB flat hard disk image.
3. Boot the DOS floppy on Bochs, using FDISK and FORMAT to
format all the hard disk image with a FAT16 partition.
4. Use the Hex editor to copy boot2.bin (boot loader) to the
boot sector of FAT16 partition in hard disk image (boot sector
location in hard disk image is 7E00h if you use Bochs default
geometry when creating hard disk image)
5. Mount the DOS floppy image using virtual floppy program,
copy the rest of .bin files (loader.bin, 8259A.bin, VGA.bin,
8042.bin, Sysutils.bin, ...) to the floppy disk
6. Run Bochs, boot the DOS floppy (be sure that you have unmounted
the floppy image), copy all the *.bin to C:\
7. Reset Bochs and choose booting from hard disk to test

It run fine on Bochs. I didn't test it on real machine yet.

If you only want to test quickly, get the pre-built image and boot
it with Bochs.
