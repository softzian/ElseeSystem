A Simple Hobby x86 "OS" for learning purpose

I don't intend to write an OS, this project provide some basic modules in order to develop programs that run without OS (run directly on hardware). It may evolve to an OS later but it isn't my current goal.

Design goals:
  - Support PC/AT Compatible System with IA-32 processor
  - Single Address Space Environment
  - Modular system
  - Direct hardware access
  
See doc/INSTALL.txt for install guide
