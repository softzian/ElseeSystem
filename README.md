A Simple Hobby x86 "OS" for learning purpose

It isn't an OS yet and for now, this project only provide some basic modules in order to develop programs that run without OS (run directly on hardware). It will evolve to an OS later.

Design goals:
  - Support PC/AT Compatible System with IA-32 processor
  - Modular system
  - Direct hardware access
  
See doc/INSTALL.txt for install guide

See Wiki or doc for more infomation (this project is under major changes so doc maybe outdated)
