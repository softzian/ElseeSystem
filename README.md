A Simple Hobby x86 "OS" for learning purpose

It isn't an OS yet and for now, this project only provide some basic modules in order to develop programs that run without OS (run directly on hardware). It will evolve to an OS later.

Design goals:
  - Support PC/AT Compatible System with IA-32 processor
  - Single Address Space Environment (not exactly a single address space, now it is double address space, one for code and one for data)
  - Modular system
  - Direct hardware access
The three last goals will never be changed, if it can not be achived, I will start a new project.
